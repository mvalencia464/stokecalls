# Testing Your Real Transcripts Setup

## ‚úÖ Quick Test Checklist

### 1. Verify Server is Running
- [x] Dev server started on http://localhost:3001
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Environment variables loaded

### 2. Test API Endpoints

#### Test Transcripts Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/transcripts
```
Expected: `{"transcripts":[],"total":0}` (empty initially)

#### Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks/ghl-call-finished
```
Expected: 
```json
{
  "message": "HighLevel Call Finished Webhook Endpoint",
  "status": "active",
  "instructions": "Send POST requests with CallFinished events"
}
```

### 3. Test UI

1. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
2. You should see the contacts list (either real from HighLevel or mock data)
3. Click on a contact
4. You should see these tabs:
   - ‚úÖ AI Insights
   - ‚úÖ Transcript
   - ‚úÖ Ask AI
   - ‚úÖ **Call Recordings** (NEW!)

### 4. Test Manual Transcription

1. Click on the **"Call Recordings"** tab
2. If you have real calls in HighLevel:
   - You should see a list of call recordings
   - Click "Transcribe" on any call
   - Wait for transcription to complete
   - Switch to "AI Insights" or "Transcript" tab to see results
3. If no calls are found:
   - Make a test call in HighLevel first
   - Or use the mock data toggle to see the UI

### 5. Verify Database Storage

After transcribing a call, check:
```bash
cat data/transcripts.json
```

You should see your transcript data stored in JSON format.

## üß™ Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test with Mock Data
1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Toggle "Use Real Data" OFF (if you don't have HighLevel set up yet)
3. Click on "Sarah Jenkins"
4. Verify all tabs work correctly
5. Note: Mock data won't have the "Call Recordings" tab functionality

### Step 2: Test with Real HighLevel Data
1. Ensure `.env.local` has valid credentials:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GHL_LOCATION_ID`
   - `GHL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`
2. Toggle "Use Real Data" ON
3. Select a contact that has call recordings
4. Go to "Call Recordings" tab
5. Click "Transcribe" on a call
6. Monitor browser console for any errors
7. Wait for transcription (can take 30-60 seconds)
8. Check other tabs for the new transcript

### Step 3: Test Webhook (Advanced)

#### Using ngrok for local testing:
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose localhost
ngrok http 3001
```

Then in HighLevel:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/ghl-call-finished`
3. Select event: `CallFinished`
4. Make a test call in HighLevel
5. Check your app - transcript should appear automatically!

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: "No call recordings found"
**Solution:** 
- Verify the contact has actual calls in HighLevel
- Check that calls have audio recordings attached
- Verify your HighLevel API credentials

### Issue: Transcription fails
**Solution:**
- Check AssemblyAI API key is valid
- Verify you have credits in AssemblyAI account
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Check server logs (terminal running `npm run dev`)

### Issue: Transcripts not showing up
**Solution:**
- Check `/data/transcripts.json` exists and has data
- Verify the contact ID matches between HighLevel and your database
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for API errors

### Issue: Webhook not receiving events
**Solution:**
- Verify webhook URL is correct in HighLevel
- Check that your app is accessible (use ngrok for local testing)
- Test webhook endpoint manually with curl
- Check HighLevel webhook logs for delivery status

## üìä Expected Behavior

### First Time Setup
1. No transcripts in database (empty)
2. "Call Recordings" tab shows available calls from HighLevel
3. Manual transcription works immediately
4. Transcripts are saved and displayed

### After Webhook Setup
1. New calls automatically trigger transcription
2. Transcripts appear without manual intervention
3. UI updates when you refresh or navigate to contact

### Production
1. All calls automatically transcribed
2. Transcripts stored in database
3. Fast loading (no need to transcribe again)
4. Historical data preserved

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Can view contacts (real or mock)
- [ ] Can see contact details
- [ ] "Call Recordings" tab appears
- [ ] Can list available call recordings
- [ ] Can manually trigger transcription
- [ ] Transcription completes successfully
- [ ] Transcript appears in "AI Insights" and "Transcript" tabs
- [ ] Data persists in `/data/transcripts.json`
- [ ] Webhook endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] No console errors

## üìù Next Steps After Testing

1. ‚úÖ Verify manual transcription works
2. ‚úÖ Deploy to production (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Set up HighLevel webhook with production URL
4. ‚úÖ Test automatic transcription with real calls
5. üîÑ Monitor for errors and edge cases
6. üîÑ Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for production scale
7. üîÑ Add monitoring and alerting
